# The default value of SiflashResumeToSuspendDelay is set to 1000us that is the minimum erase/program resume to suspend
# delay that must be respected to avoid errors for all the QSPI flashes supported.  
# 
# Cypress/Spansion S25FS-S QSPI flash requires minimum erase/program resume to suspend
# delay that must be respected to avoid errors, 50us is recommended by Cypress.
#
# If QSPI other than Cypress/Spansion is used, this value should be amended according to
# the flash datasheet.
#
# Note that this controls minimum delay and not a typical or average delay required
# for a flash command to progress, which is often also specified in the datasheet.
#
# If the minimum delay required by the flash part is not stated in its datasheet
# please contact the flash manufacturer for clarification.

SiflashResumeToSuspendDelay = 1000
